# Service NSW Web Scraper

This project allows you to find the availabilities at every location for your Hazard Perception Test using Selenium. It all works in the background.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
Install main.py, mainGUI.py and chromedriver.exe
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Install main.py, mainGUI.py and chromedriver.exe
```

```
Once installed, run main.py. It should create a csv file called availabilities with all the availabilities
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
